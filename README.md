## Rocket Elevators Go Controller 

![alt text](https://github.com/DaveVaval/Rocket-Elevators-Ruby-Controller/blob/Main/img/R3.png)

Welcome to the Go controller for Rocket Elevators! 

- Go  is not a language optimized for oriented programming, but I worked my way around it and made it work!


An instance of Battery is created and on initialization, that battery will create it's own columns and elevators. When a en elevator is called, the column will send the best elevator to the user based on the different attributes of the elevators and the origin of the request.

In order to see it in action, uncomment one of the scenarios in the main function:

```
// Scenario1() , // Scenario2() , // Scenario3() , // Scenario4()
```
